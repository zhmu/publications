\section*{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, this thesis would not be its current form without the help of my supervisor, Michel Reniers. We regularly discussed the current results and reflected upon the status of the work, which both have really aided me during this project. I would also like to thank Simon Janssen for the useful discussions and constructive criticism while performing the project, as well as all other persons who have read my thesis and provided useful comments. Last but not least, the mCRL2 development team has been very responsive in regard to my bug reports - I would especially like to thank Jeroen van der Wulp for his patience and help.
