\chapter*{Abstract}

The SmartPixel system consists of a set of independent nodes, which have to cooperate in order to accomplish desired functionality. This makes the system a good example of a completely distributed system: all nodes have to work together to achieve the intended result. The result is that the SmartPixel system is very well suited for a detailed analysis.

In the thesis, we will first present the SmartPixel system and provide an introduction to the process theory used. From then on, the different phases of the system will be individually modeled and validated, after which the focus will be on the system as a whole. The remainder of the thesis will attempt to transform timed models to untimed models in an attempt to prove more properties of the system. Finally, the findings are summarized in the concluding words.
