\section*{Preface}

As systems keep on growing more and more complicated, the need to formally analyze such systems becomes evident: pure intuition and experience are no longer sufficient. An interesting way to analyze the behavior of systems is by means of process theory: a system can be described in terms of processes. Such a specification can be used to subsequently prove desired properties, either by model inspection or by using temporal logic. This thesis details the process of transforming an external specification to a formal process specification and validating whether desired properties hold using the mCRL2 toolkit. The latter is especially of interest as the analyzed system heavily depends on the notion of time, which has prompted interesting challenges during the modeling and verification process.
