# Publications

In the course of my education and hobbies, I've written some reports or articles which may be interesting to some.

* **Lecture**: [How hackers grind an MMORPG: by taking it apart](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/Fahrplan/events/7493.html) (2015)
    The presentation I held at the 32th Chaos Communication Congress, it details my journey into reverse engineering the network protocol used by an MMORPG. The main focus is on the process, the tools and it contains a nice demonstration of the techniques.
* **Master Thesis**: [Design and verification of the SmartPixel II protocol](master-thesis.pdf) (2008)
    This is my master's thesis while studying at [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl). It discusses designing a protocol for a network of highly-independant nodes and applying formal validation to such a design by means of process algebra. As the protocol inherently relies on the notion of time, a conversion between timed and untimed process algebras is also discussed.
* [Linux 2.6 VFS Locking](linux-vfs-locking.pdf) (2007)
    This short article details the locking and reference counting internals of the Linux 2.6 Virtual File System. It was written for the Linux Kernel / Hacker's Hut course at the [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl)
 * **Bachelor Thesis**: [The LIME Realtime Filesystem](philips-graduation-report.pdf) (2005)
    This is my graduation thesis while studying for my Bachelor of ICT at [Fontys University of Applied Sciences](https://www.fontys.nl). It details researching and implementing a real time file system in Linux but also includes all technical aspects regarding the implementation in appendix A.
 * **Second Internship**: [The Delem HSB Analyzer](delem-stage-verslag.pdf) (Dutch, 2004)
    The report of my second internship for my bachelor, this report details designing and implementing an analyzer tool for messages on the [Delem](https://www.delem.com) HSB bus.
