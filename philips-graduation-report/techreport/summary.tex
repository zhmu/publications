What is the basic design, what does a filesystem have to provide? Focuses mostly on the Linux Virtual File System layer.
\item LIMEFS \\
Overall design ideas of the LIMEFS filesystem, as well as all structures used within the LIMEFS filesystem.
\item Implementation \\
Linux Implementation-specific details of the filesystem.
\end{itemize}

The overall conclusion of the report is a stable filesystem which is very suitable for storing large files of a few gigabytes. There is room for improvement, especially within the administration part of the filesystem. As for most multimedia applications, the filesystem is ready to be used.
