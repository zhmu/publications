This report is about the technical aspects of the filesystem created during my internship at Philips Research in Eindhoven. It is written in an informative manner, which should provide the reader with a clear overview of the design and implementation of the filesystem.

The target audience is mostly software engineers having an interest in the LIMEFS design/implementation. The Linux VFS implementation is also briefly outlined, more details can be found in \cite{LDD}. This report assumes generic filesystem knowledge.

I'd like to to thank the following people who helped me during my internship: Bas van Tiel, Michiel van Slobbe, Ron Eringa, Ron Lievens, Ad Denissen, Mischa Geldermans, Christ Vriens, Werner Almesberger, Wim van de Goor and Wim Zijlmans.
