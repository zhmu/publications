This technical report describes the LIMEFS filesystem. This filesystem was written during my graduation project of my Computer Sciences study at Fontys Hogescholen in Eindhoven and carried out at Philips Research in Eindhoven. The goal was design and implement a framework for realtime file storage, which came down to implementing a realtime filesystem which can provide guaranteed I/O performance.

The report will provide a rough description of the Linux Virtual File System structure. The next part will focus completely on the design and implementation of the XXFS filesystem, followed by concluding statements on the project.
