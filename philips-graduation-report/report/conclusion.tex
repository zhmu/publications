During this internship, I've learned a lot about the Linux kernel, especially with respect to file systems and block I/O layers.

I feel I have gotten a very good impression of Extreme Programming. It is extremely useful to see how this method is being used in a company, and how everything is managed on top of this method. Writing and using tests was very hard while doing kernel development, but several administrative parts of the filesystem were designed so they could easily be tested.

Furthermore, I was surprised at the freedom which I had while performing this project. During previous internships, my mentor there gave me a specific task which needed to be carried out. During this internship, my internship mentor actually encouraged me to make suggestions and come up with my own ideas. Working within a true team was also extremely pleasant, not to mention a new experience to me.

Finally, I am very pleased with the result of this internship. Not only have I learned a lot about Linux filesystems and I/O internals, but also about Extreme Programming and how very useful it can be to help someone if they are stuck with a problem in their code.
