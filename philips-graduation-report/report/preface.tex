\chapter{Preface}
\index{preface}

This report will describe my graduation internship at Philips Research in Eindhoven. It is written in an informative manner, with the exception of my personal evaluation which, of course, can't be objective or purely informative. The report is written using the guidelines as outlined in \cite{ROR}.

The goal of the internship was to design and implement a real time filesystem for Linux. This is illustrated further in the project description on page \pageref{project}.

The target audience is mostly people having an interest in the process or the execution of my internship. The technical documentation of the project is a separate document, which is included as appendix A. The project management plan, or \emph{plan van aanpak}, is included as appendix B.

Finally, I'd like to to thank the following people who helped me during my internship: Bas van Tiel, Michiel van Slobbe, Ron Eringa, Ad Denissen, Mischa Geldermans, Christ Vriens, Werner Almesberger and Wim Zijlmans.
