\chapter{Summary}
\index{summary}

This report provides an in-depth view of my graduation internship at Philips Research. The direct result is a Linux filesystem which can be compiled directly into the kernel itself, utilities to create, verify and debug the filesystem and finally a technical report on the internals of the filesystem, as well as the graduation report, which you are currently reading.

During this internship, I've looked deeply in the Linux kernel, especially with regard to filesystems and disk I/O. This resulted in knowledge about Linux kernel internals, which will surely be useful in the future. The aspects of Extreme Programming were also widely applied.
